# JAFinal
Skibidi

I don't likr it. I feel like our final should've been something creative. I faced many challanges. one being that my css was not being recognized as css despit being in a .css file. Another being that my list would overwrite itself, so I couldn't get the individul tasks so I couldn't appl styling (If that wouldve worked), make a completion button, or a delete button. I know the problem iis probably that I have an empty object I' using, but m code doesn't work if I make iit dynamic ly.
