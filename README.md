# JAFinal
Skibidi

I don't like it. I feel like our final should've been something more creative (and done independtly)
I faced many challanges. one being that my css was not being recognized as css despit being in a .css file. 
Another being that my list would overwrite itself, so I couldn't get the individul tasks so I couldn't apply styling (If that would've worked), make a completion button, 
or a delete button. I know the problem is probably that I have an empty object I'm using, but my code doesn't work if I make it dynamicly.
